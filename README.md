# delphi-covid-19
Delphi conducts a voluntary COVID-19 symptom survey, distributed daily via a partnership with Facebook. This repository contains code and analysis of the data. The data is protected and is, therefore, not shared here.

This survey asks respondents about COVID-like symptoms, their behavior (such as social distancing), mental health, and economic and health impacts they have experienced as a result of the pandemic. A high-level overview of the survey is posted on the [COVIDcast website](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/surveys/).

The symptom surveys have been deployed in several waves.
